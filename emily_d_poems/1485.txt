Through the strait pass of suffering —
The Martyrs — even — trod.
Their feet — upon Temptations —
Their faces — upon God —

A stately — shriven — Company —
Convulsion — playing round —
Harmless — as streaks of Meteor —
Upon a Planet's Bond —

Their faith — the everlasting troth —
Their Expectation — fair —
The Needle — to the North Degree —
Wades — so — thro' polar Air!
