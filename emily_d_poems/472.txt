My little devices to live till Monday would woo your sad attention - Full of work and plots and little happinesses the Thought of you protracts them all and makes them sham and cold -
      How fleet - how indiscreet an one -
      how always wrong is Love -
      The joyful little Deity
      We are not scourged to serve -
