It's thoughts — and just One Heart —
And Old Sunshine — about —
Make frugal — Ones — Content —
And two or three — for Company —
Upon a Holiday —
Crowded — as Sacrament —

Books — when the Unit —
Spare the Tenant — long eno' —
A Picture — if it Care —
Itself — a Gallery too rare —
For needing more —

Flowers — to keep the Eyes — from going awkward —
When it snows —
A Bird — if they — prefer —
Though Winter fire — sing clear as Plover —
To our — ear —

A Landscape — not so great
To suffocate the Eye —
A Hill — perhaps —
Perhaps — the profile of a Mill
Turned by the Wind —
Tho' such — are luxuries —

It's thoughts — and just two Heart —
And Heaven — about —
At least — a Counterfeit —
We would not have Correct —
And Immortality — can be almost —
Not quite — Content —
