The Gentian has a parched Corolla —
Like azure dried
'Tis Nature's buoyant juices
Beatified —
Without a vaunt or sheen
As casual as Rain
And as benign —

When most is part — it comes —
Nor isolate it seems
Its Bond its Friend —
To fill its Fringed career
And aid an aged Year
Abundant end —

Its lot — were it forgot —
This Truth endear —
Fidelity is gain
Creation is o'er —
