Sleep is supposed to be,
By souls of sanity,
The shutting of the eye.

Sleep is the station grand
Down which on either hand
The hosts of witness stand !

Morn is supposed to be,
By people of degree,
The breaking of the day.

Morning has not occurred !
That shall aurora be
East of eternity ;

One with the banner gay,
One in the red array, —
That is the break of day.
