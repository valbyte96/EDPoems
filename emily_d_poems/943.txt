One Crucifixion is recorded — only —
How many be
Is not affirmed of Mathematics —
Or History —

One Calvary — exhibited to Stranger —
As many be
As persons — or Peninsulas —
Gethsemane —

Is but a Province — in the Being's Centre —
Judea —
For Journey — or Crusade's Achieving —
Too near —

Our Lord — indeed — made Compound Witness —
And yet —
There's newer — nearer Crucifixion
Than That —
