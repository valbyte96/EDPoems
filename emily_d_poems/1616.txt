We — Bee and I — live by the quaffing —
'Tisn't all Hock — with us —
Life has its Ale —
But it's many a lay of the Dim Burgundy —
We chant — for cheer — when the Wines — fail —

Do we "get drunk"?
Ask the jolly Clovers!
Do we "beat" our "Wife"?
I — never wed —
Bee — pledges his — in minute flagons —
Dainty — as the trees — on our deft Head —

While runs the Rhine —
He and I — revel —
First — at the vat — and latest at the Vine —
Noon — our last Cup —
"Found dead" — "of Nectar" —
By a humming Coroner —
In a By-Thyme!
