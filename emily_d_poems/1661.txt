What is — "Paradise" —
Who live there —
Are they "Farmers" —
Do they "hoe" —
Do they know that this is "Amherst" —
And that I — am coming — too —

Do they wear "new shoes" — in "Eden" —
Is it always pleasant — there —
Won't they scold us — when we're homesick —
Or tell God — how cross we are —

You are sure there's such a person
As "a Father" — in the sky —
So if I get lost — there — ever —
Or do what the Nurse calls "die" —
I shan't walk the "Jasper" — barefoot —
Ransomed folks — won't laugh at me —
Maybe — "Eden" a'n't so lonesome
As New England used to be!
