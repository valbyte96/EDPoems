One Year ago — jots what?
God — spell the word! I — can't —
Was't Grace? Not that —
Was't Glory? That — will do —
Spell slower — Glory —

Such Anniversary shall be —
Sometimes — not often — in Eternity —
When farther Parted, than the Common Woe —
Look — feed upon each other's faces — so —
In doubtful meal, if it be possible
Their Banquet's true —

I tasted — careless — then —
I did not know the Wine
Came once a World — Did you?
Oh, had you told me so —
This Thirst would blister — easier — now —
You said it hurt you — most —
Mine — was an Acorn's Breast —
And could not know how fondness grew
In Shaggier Vest —
Perhaps — I couldn't —
But, had you looked in —
A Giant — eye to eye with you, had been —
No Acorn — then —

So — Twelve months ago —
We breathed —
Then dropped the Air —
Which bore it best?
Was this — the patientest —
Because it was a Child, you know —
And could not value — Air?

If to be "Elder" — mean most pain —
I'm old enough, today, I'm certain — then —
As old as thee — how soon?
One — Birthday more — or Ten?
Let me — choose!
Ah, Sir, None!
