The Sunrise runs for Both —
The East — Her Purple Troth
Keeps with the Hill —
The Noon unwinds Her Blue
Till One Breadth cover Two —
Remotest — still —

Nor does the Night forget
A Lamp for Each — to set —
Wicks wide away —
The North — Her blazing Sign
Erects in Iodine —
Till Both — can see —

The Midnight's Dusky Arms
Clasp Hemispheres, and Homes
And so
Upon Her Bosom — One —
And One upon Her Hem —
Both lie —
