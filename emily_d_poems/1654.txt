Wert Thou but ill — that I might show thee
How long a Day I could endure
Though thine attention stop not on me
Nor the least signal, Me assure —

Wert Thou but Stranger in ungracious country —
And Mine — the Door
Thou paused at, for a passing bounty —
No More —

Accused — wert Thou — and Myself — Tribunal —
Convicted — Sentenced — Ermine — not to Me
Half the Condition, thy Reverse — to follow —
Just to partake — the infamy —

The Tenant of the Narrow Cottage, wert Thou —
Permit to be
The Housewife in thy low attendance
Contenteth Me —

No Service hast Thou, I would not achieve it —
To die — or live —
The first — Sweet, proved I, ere I saw thee —
For Life — be Love —
