It tossed — and tossed —
A little Brig I knew — o'ertook by Blast —
It spun — and spun —
And groped delirious, for Morn —

It slipped — and slipped —
As One that drunken — stept —
Its white foot tripped —
Then dropped from sight —

Ah, Brig — Good Night
To Crew and You —
The Ocean's Heart too smooth — too Blue —
To break for You —
