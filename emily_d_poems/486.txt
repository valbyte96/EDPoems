How noteless Men, and Pleiads, stand,
Until a sudden sky
Reveals the fact that One is rapt
Forever from the Eye —

Members of the Invisible,
Existing, while we stare,
In Leagueless Opportunity,
O'ertakenless, as the Air —

Why didn't we detain Them?
The Heavens with a smile,
Sweep by our disappointed Heads
Without a syllable —
