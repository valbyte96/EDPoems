They put Us far apart —
As separate as Sea
And Her unsown Peninsula —
We signified "These see" —

They took away our Eyes —
They thwarted Us with Guns —
"I see Thee" each responded straight
Through Telegraphic Signs —

With Dungeons — They devised —
But through their thickest skill —
And their opaquest Adamant —
Our Souls saw — just as well —

They summoned Us to die —
With sweet alacrity
We stood upon our stapled feet —
Condemned — but just — to see —

Permission to recant —
Permission to forget —
We turned our backs upon the Sun
For perjury of that —

Not Either — noticed Death —
Of Paradise — aware —
Each other's Face — was all the Disc
Each other's setting — saw —
