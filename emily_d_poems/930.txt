On a Columnar Self —
How ample to rely
In Tumult — or Extremity —
How good the Certainty

That Lever cannot pry —
And Wedge cannot divide
Conviction — That Granitic Base —
Though None be on our Side —

Suffice Us — for a Crowd —
Ourself — and Rectitude —
And that Assembly — not far off
From furthest Spirit — God —
