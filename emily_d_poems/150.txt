Art thou the thing I wanted?
Begone — my Tooth has grown —
Supply the minor Palate
That has not starved so long —
I tell thee while I waited
The mystery of Food
Increased till I abjured it
And dine without Like God —

Art thou the thing I wanted?
Begone — my Tooth has grown —
Affront a minor palate
Thou could'st not goad so long —

I tell thee while I waited —
The mystery of Food
Increased till I abjured it
Subsisting now like God —
