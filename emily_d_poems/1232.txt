A sphere of simple green,
With only butterflies to brood,
And bees to entertain,

And stir all day to pretty tunes
The breezes fetch along,
And hold the sunshine in its lap
And bow to everything ;

And thread the dews all night, like pearls,
And make myself so fine, —
A duchess were too common
For such a noticing.
