Sang from the Heart, Sire,
Dipped my Beak in it,
If the Tune drip too much
Have a tint too Red

Pardon the Cochineal —
Suffer the Vermillion —
Death is the Wealth
Of the Poorest Bird.

Bear with the Ballad —
Awkward — faltering —
Death twists the strings —
'Twasn't my blame —

Pause in your Liturgies —
Wait your Chorals —
While I repeat your
Hallowed name —
