On this long storm the rainbow rose,
On this late morn the sun ;
The clouds, like listless elephants,
Horizons straggled down.

The birds rose smiling in their nests,
The gales indeed were done ;
Alas !  how heedless were the eyes
On whom the summer shone !

The quiet nonchalance of death
No daybreak can bestir ;
The slow archangel's syllables
Must awaken her.
