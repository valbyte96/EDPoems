What would I give to see his face?
I'd give — I'd give my life — of course —
But that is not enough!
Stop just a minute — let me think!
I'd give my biggest Bobolink!
That makes two — Him — and Life!
You know who "June" is —
I'd give her —
Roses a day from Zanzibar —
And Lily tubes — like Wells —
Bees — by the furlong —
Straits of Blue
Navies of Butterflies — sailed thro' —
And dappled Cowslip Dells —

Then I have "shares" in Primrose "Banks" —
Daffodil Dowries — spicy "Stocks" —
Dominions — broad as Dew —
Bags of Doublons — adventurous Bees
Brought me — from firmamental seas —
And Purple — from Peru —

Now — have I bought it —
"Shylock"? Say!
Sign me the Bond!
"I vow to pay
To Her — who pledges this —
One hour — of her Sovereign's face"!
Ecstatic Contract!
Niggard Grace!
My Kingdom's worth of Bliss!
