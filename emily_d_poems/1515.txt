To disappear enhances —
The Man that runs away
Is tinctured for an instant
With Immortality

But yesterday a Vagrant —
Today in Memory lain
With superstitious value
We tamper with "Again"

But "Never" far as Honor
Withdraws the Worthless thing
And impotent to cherish
We hasten to adorn —

Of Death the sternest function
That just as we discern
The Excellence defies us —
Securest gathered then

The Fruit perverse to plucking,
But leaning to the Sight
With the ecstatic limit
Of unobtained Delight —
