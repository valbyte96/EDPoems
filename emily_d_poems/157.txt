And in my wondering hand,
A stranger pressed a kingdom -
And I - bewildered stand -
As if I asked the Orient
Had it for me a morn?
And it sh'd lift it's purple dikes
And flood me with the Dawn!


Version 2 The "hand you stretch me in the Dark", I put mine in, and turn away - I have no Saxon, now -
As if I asked a common Alms,
And in my wondering hand
A Stranger pressed a Kingdom,
And I, bewildered, stand -
As if I asked the Orient
Had it for me a Morn -
And it should lift its purple Dikes,
And shatter Me with Dawn!




Version 3 Thank you for the Grave - empty and full - too -
As if I asked a common Alms and in my wondering Hand
A stranger pressed a Kingdom, and I bewildered stand,
As if I asked the Orient had it for me a Morn,
And it should lift it's purple Dikes, and shatter me with Dawn -





Version appearing in Thomas Johnson, Collected Poems

As if I asked a common Alms -
And in my wondering hand
A Stranger pressed a Kingdom,
And I, bewildered, stand -
As if I asked the Orient
Had it for me a Morn -
And it should lift its purple Dikes,
And shatter Me with Dawn!
