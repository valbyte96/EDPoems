He preached upon "Breadth" till it argued him narrow —
The Broad are too broad to define
And of "Truth" until it proclaimed him a Liar —
The Truth never flaunted a Sign —

Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence
As Gold the Pyrites would shun —
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus
To meet so enabled a Man!
