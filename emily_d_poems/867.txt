No matter — now — Sweet —
But when I'm Earl —
Won't you wish you'd spoken
To that dull Girl?

Trivial a Word — just —
Trivial — a Smile —
But won't you wish you'd spared one
When I'm Earl?

I shan't need it — then —
Crests — will do —
Eagles on my Buckles —
On my Belt — too —

Ermine — my familiar Gown —
Say — Sweet — then
Won't you wish you'd smiled — just —
Me upon?
