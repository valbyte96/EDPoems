No Brigadier throughout the Year
So civic as the Jay —
A Neighbor and a Warrior too
With shrill felicity
Pursuing Winds that censure us
A February Day,
The Brother of the Universe
Was never blown away —
The Snow and he are intimate —
I've often seem them play
When Heaven looked upon us all
With such severity
I felt apology were due
To an insulted sky
Whose pompous frown was Nutriment
To their Temerity —
The Pillow of this daring Head
Is pungent Evergreens —
His Larder — terse and Militant —
Unknown — refreshing things —
His Character — a Tonic —
His future — a Dispute —
Unfair an Immortality
That leaves this Neighbor out —
